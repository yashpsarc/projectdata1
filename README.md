SQL Project: Employee Management System
Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to design and implement an employee management system using SQL. The system will manage data for employees, departments, and job roles, with features for managing employee records, querying for performance, and analyzing department data.

Database Design:
Entities and Relationships:
Employee: Stores personal and employment-related data.
Department: Stores information about departments in the company.
Job: Stores job roles and titles.
Salary: Tracks salary changes and history for employees.
Schema Diagram:
Employee (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Gender, DateOfBirth, HireDate, DepartmentID, JobID)
Department (DepartmentID, DepartmentName, ManagerID)
Job (JobID, JobTitle, MinSalary, MaxSalary)
Salary (SalaryID, EmployeeID, SalaryAmount, EffectiveDate)
Step 1: Database Creation
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE EmployeeManagement;
USE EmployeeManagement;
Step 2: Table Creation
Employee Table
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Gender CHAR(1),
    DateOfBirth DATE,
    HireDate DATE,
    DepartmentID INT,
    JobID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Department(DepartmentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (JobID) REFERENCES Job(JobID)
);
Department Table

Copy code
CREATE TABLE Department (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    ManagerID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (ManagerID) REFERENCES Employee(EmployeeID)
);
Job Table
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Job (
    JobID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    JobTitle VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    MinSalary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    MaxSalary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
Salary Table
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Salary (
    SalaryID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    EmployeeID INT,
    SalaryAmount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    EffectiveDate DATE NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employee(EmployeeID)
);
Step 3: Inserting Sample Data
Insert Job Roles
sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO Job (JobTitle, MinSalary, MaxSalary) VALUES
('Software Engineer', 60000, 120000),
('Data Analyst', 50000, 100000),
('HR Manager', 70000, 150000),
('Marketing Manager', 75000, 140000);
Insert Departments
sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO Department (DepartmentName, ManagerID) VALUES
('IT', 1),
('HR', 2),
('Marketing', 3),
('Finance', 4);
Insert Employees
sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO Employee (FirstName, LastName, Gender, DateOfBirth, HireDate, DepartmentID, JobID) VALUES
('John', 'Doe', 'M', '1990-01-15', '2018-06-23', 1, 1),
('Jane', 'Smith', 'F', '1988-03-22', '2017-04-15', 2, 3),
('Robert', 'Brown', 'M', '1992-05-10', '2019-07-10', 3, 4),
('Emily', 'Johnson', 'F', '1985-12-05', '2016-01-20', 1, 2);
Insert Salary Records
sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO Salary (EmployeeID, SalaryAmount, EffectiveDate) VALUES
(1, 85000, '2018-06-23'),
(2, 90000, '2017-04-15'),
(3, 100000, '2019-07-10'),
(4, 70000, '2016-01-20');
Step 4: Query Examples
1. Retrieve Employee Information
Retrieve basic employee information such as their name, department, and job title.

sql
Copy code
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName, d.DepartmentName, j.JobTitle
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
JOIN Job j ON e.JobID = j.JobID;
2. Calculate Average Salary by Department
Calculate the average salary of employees in each department.

sql
Copy code
SELECT d.DepartmentName, AVG(s.SalaryAmount) AS AverageSalary
FROM Employee e
JOIN Salary s ON e.EmployeeID = s.EmployeeID
JOIN Department d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName;
3. List Employees and Their Salary History
List employees along with their salary history.

sql
Copy code
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, s.SalaryAmount, s.EffectiveDate
FROM Employee e
JOIN Salary s ON e.EmployeeID = s.EmployeeID
ORDER BY e.EmployeeID, s.EffectiveDate;
4. Find Highest-Paid Employee
Identify the employee with the highest salary.

sql
Copy code
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, MAX(s.SalaryAmount) AS HighestSalary
FROM Employee e
JOIN Salary s ON e.EmployeeID = s.EmployeeID
GROUP BY e.EmployeeID
ORDER BY HighestSalary DESC
LIMIT 1;
5. Retrieve Employees by Department
Retrieve all employees from a specific department, for example, the "IT" department.

sql
Copy code
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE d.DepartmentName = 'IT';
Step 5: Advanced Queries
1. Total Salary Expenses by Department
Calculate the total salary expense for each department.

sql
Copy code
SELECT d.DepartmentName, SUM(s.SalaryAmount) AS TotalSalaryExpenses
FROM Employee e
JOIN Salary s ON e.EmployeeID = s.EmployeeID
JOIN Department d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName;
2. List of Employees Who Havenâ€™t Received a Raise in the Last 2 Years
Find employees who have not received a salary change in over 2 years.

sql
Copy code
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, MAX(s.EffectiveDate) AS LastRaiseDate
FROM Employee e
JOIN Salary s ON e.EmployeeID = s.EmployeeID
GROUP BY e.EmployeeID
HAVING MAX(s.EffectiveDate) < CURDATE() - INTERVAL 2 YEAR;
3. Employee Age Distribution
Calculate the age of each employee and group by age range.

sql
Copy code
SELECT CASE 
        WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, DateOfBirth, CURDATE()) < 30 THEN 'Under 30'
        WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, DateOfBirth, CURDATE()) BETWEEN 30 AND 40 THEN '30-40'
        ELSE 'Above 40'
    END AS AgeRange,
    COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees
FROM Employee
GROUP BY AgeRange;
Step 6: Indexes and Optimization
For performance optimization, you can add indexes on frequently queried fields such as EmployeeID, DepartmentID, and JobID.

sql
Copy code
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_department ON Employee(DepartmentID);
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_job ON Employee(JobID);
Step 7: Backup and Restore
Create a backup of the database to ensure that you can recover it in case of a failure.

sql
Copy code
-- To backup the database
mysqldump -u root -p EmployeeManagement > employee_management_backup.sql

-- To restore the database
mysql -u root -p EmployeeManagement < employee_management_backup.sql
Conclusion:
This SQL-based Employee Management System project covers key features such as employee data management, salary tracking, department management, and performance analysis through advanced queries. By following these steps, you can create a fully functional SQL database, optimize it for performance, and derive meaningful insights through SQL queries.
